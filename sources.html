       <h2>Our Various Sources</h2> </center>
            <p><b>"Children At Work, Child Labor and Modern Slavery in India: An Overview"</b>
	<br>This article discusses how child labor in India is a form of modern slavery, as many children are forced into exploitative work under hazardous conditions, emphasizing that illiteracy and poverty perpetuate this cycle. The information from this source helped to understand the perpetuity of modern slavery and the methods by which it persists.<br>
<br><b><i>Approaches to Modern Slavery in Supply Chains in Australia and the Pacific</b></i>
	<br>This article discusses ongoing efforts to stop modern slavery in Australia and the Pacific and the companies that rely upon it. The information from this source helped to understand how global indifference may be addressed, and the methods by which it can be reduced through active efforts.<br>
<br><b>"Fighting Slavery by 'Presenting Facts in Detail': Realism, Typology, and Temporality in Uncle Tom's Cabin"</b>
	<br>This article discusses a prior use of literature as an antislavery tool and offers proof that combating slavery in this way is possible.<br>
<br><b><i>Modern Slavery in African Land</b></i>
	<br>This book discusses the various human rights violations done throughout the process, even stating how most of the women who were chosen for the study had said that “the work conditions they were engaged in Sudan was abusive". The information from this source helped us learn about how people can be trafficked into slavery, and potential ways that knowledge can help individuals avoid this.<br>
<br><b>"Realising Rights: Poverty and Adult Literacy in a Globalizing Arab Region"</b>
	<br>This article discusses how illiteracy is related to poverty. Specifically, the article studies the role of literacy in one’s personal capabilities. In other words, the impact that certain pieces of literature can or do have on the lives of individuals stuck in cycles of poverty is entirely dependent on the capabilities—specifically literacy—of those individuals. The information from this source helped us learn how to consider literacy rates as part of the problem and solution.<br>
<br><b>How Books Get Translated</b>
	<br>Traditionally, books are translated by professionals fluent and knowledgeable in the languages into which they translate a piece of literature. We are likely to employ this method by seeking out individual translators from those regions and asking them for help. However, this method can be slow, and finding these translators can be difficult, but recent advancements in AI have shown potential in literary translation. Using AI for translation is a new area, and AI isn't quite good enough to rely on for this yet, but this method could also be employed in the future for the sustainability of this project.<br>
<br><b>Copyright Law</b>
	Translating a piece of literature necessitates that copyright law be considered. In the US, our main consideration would be regarding licensing a derivative work, which is a work derived from the original. This new work must change the work to a significant extent while still being close enough to the original to be considered a derived work. Translating a book falls into this category. For this reason, we must obtain legal permission from the author(s) of literary works before the translation process.																																																												     >
